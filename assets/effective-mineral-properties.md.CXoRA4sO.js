The upper and lower bounds of both methods are also included in the plots. The bounds for Hashin-Shtrikman are notably narrower than for Voigt and Reuss bounds, with the latter representing the stiffest and softest theoretical combinations, respectively.</p><img src="'+o+'"><span id="figure-1-bulk-modulus"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Bulk modulus for a mix of quartz and marine clay.</span><br><br><img src="'+s+'"><span id="figure-2-shear-modulus"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Shear modulus for a mix of quartz and marine clay.</span><br><br>',19)]))}const v=t(n,[["render",l]]);export{p as __pageData,v as default};
